# Diabetes Predictor

This is a Python script that uses Scikit-learn library to predict the occurrence of diabetes based on a given set of inputs.

## Getting Started

These instructions will get you a copy of the project up and running on your local machine for testing purposes.

### Prerequisites

This script requires the following dependencies to be installed:

- Pandas
- NumPy
- Scikit-learn

You can install them by running the following command:

```
pip install pandas numpy scikit-learn
```

### Installing

1. Clone the repository to your local machine using the following command:

   ```
   git clone https://github.com/your_username/diabetes-predictor.git
   ```

2. Navigate to the repository directory.

   ```
   cd diabetes-predictor
   ```

3. Run the script.

   ```
   python diabetes_predictor.py
   ```

## Usage

This script prompts the user to input values for each feature in the dataset and then predicts whether diabetes is detected or not based on those inputs. The user input should match the following columns of the original dataset:

- Pregnancies
- Glucose
- BloodPressure
- SkinThickness
- Insulin
- BMI
- DiabetesPedigreeFunction
- Age

The model has an accuracy of about 80%.
